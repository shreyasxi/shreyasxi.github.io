Hello, I’m **Shreyas Urgunde**, currently pursuing an MSc in Finance at Warwick Business School. I spend my days making sense of markets, financial structures, and the stories we tell to convince the world (and often ourselves) that risk is manageable, value is objective, and efficiency is real (spoiler: it rarely is).

My **research interests** sit at the intersection of financial markets, macroeconomics, and digital currencies. I’m particularly fascinated by how central bank communication, market narratives, and emerging technologies influence asset pricing and systemic risks. My current dissertation, supervised by Professor Philippe Muller, examines how the tone of ECB communications differentially impacts various financial markets. 

Outside the academic space, I’ve created a number of **educational platforms** to make topics like economics, finance, geopolitics, and social justice more accessible to wider audiences. These platforms have a combined following of over 7,000 people and include:

1. [**Empowered Humans of Earth**](https://www.instagram.com/empowered.humans.of.earth/) – exploring economics, social issues, privacy and current affairs  
2. [**The Economics Hub**](https://www.instagram.com/the.economics.hub/) – curating macro trends and financial explainers  
3. [**The Economics Hub on Substack**](https://economicshub.substack.com/) – deep dives on various topics. Please follow my weekly newsletter!

I’m proficient in R, Python, LaTeX, and Excel, with working knowledge of Stata for tasks like panel regressions and applied econometrics. I enjoy building financial models and making complex data easier to interpret and explain.

When I’m not working on the usual finance stuff. I like to: 

- 📚 Read books — sometimes for leisure, often to deepen my understanding of a particular field
- 🍳 Cook meals without planning — usually hoping to discover something new through randomness
- 🛡️ Explore privacy, threat modelling, and decentralised technologies 
- ⚽ Watch football and Tennis  
- 🏃 Go for a run to clear my mind and reset
