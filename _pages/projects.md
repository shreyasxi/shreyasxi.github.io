**1. Volatility and Risk Modelling in Currency Markets**  
This project evaluates volatility and Value-at-Risk (VaR) models to forecast risk in two portfolios: one with nine developed market currencies and another including the Argentine peso. The results show that standard models often underestimate extreme risks in emerging markets. Backtesting confirms the importance of using flexible, adaptive models to better capture unexpected market movements.

**2. Empirical Finance: Mutual Fund Performance & Predictability**  
This project explores return predictability using volatility measures and evaluates mutual fund performance through Fama-French factor models. It also includes a custom portfolio analysis of the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks, comparing their performance with selected funds across key financial metrics.

**3. Asset Pricing Models in the Corporate Bond Market**  
Building on the extensive body of research exploring risk factors in equity markets, this project evaluates multiple factor models to identify the determinants of corporate bond risk premia. While the traditional CAPM is relevant, multi-factor models that include duration-adjusted market risk (MKTDB) and momentum offer a superior fit. The analysis concludes that the model balancing market and credit factors (MKTB+MKTDB) is most effective, highlighting the limitations of a standalone momentum factor and confirming the need for bond-specific risks for accurate pricing.
